## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, engine='sashtml', engine.path="C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe", engine.opts="-nosplash -linesize 75", comment=""}



proc means data=sashelp.class;
run;

proc freq data=sashelp.class;
    tables sex;
run;
```

```{r ggplot_mpg}



ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```
