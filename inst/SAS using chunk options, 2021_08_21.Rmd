## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{sas, engine='sashtml', engine.path="C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe", engine.opts="-nosplash -linesize 75"}

proc means data=sashelp.class;
run;

proc freq data=sashelp.class;
    tables sex;
run;
```
  
```{r - ggplot}

# THIS WILL NOT WORK BECAUSE SASHTML HAS BEEN SET FOR THE WHOLE DOCUMENT
# IN THE SETUP CHUNK AT THE BEGINNING.

library(ggplot2)

```
